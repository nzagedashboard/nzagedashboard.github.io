## To do

- Get the historical data
- Set up API to connect with Survey Monkey
- Set up CRON job to do updates
  - GitHub connection
- Check n for bespokes
- Fix email (optional)
- Add a URL if Seren wants (optional)


To ask for
- Historical bespokes counts?
- Threshold for bespokes still the same (10)?

## Progress to date

The below charts track **complete** graduate, intern and employer surveys, as well as how many bespoke reports have been earned. 

#### Note on bespoke reports
An organisation earns a bespoke report when 10 or more of their graduates complete the graduate survey. They must also be a member of the NZAGEâ€”this update data only reflects whether they have 10 or more complete graduate response. Double check NZAGE status before confirming with an organisation.

  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  complete(Employer, type, fill = list(n = 0)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = Employer, names_from = type, values_from = n) %>% 
  rename(`Complete Employer Survey?` = Employers) %>% 
  mutate(`Complete Employer Survey?` = if_else(`Complete Employer Survey?` > 0, "Yes", "No")) %>% 
  mutate(`Bespoke report?` = if_else(Grads >= 10, "Yes", "No")) %>% 
  select(everything(), Grads, `Bespoke report?`)

```

This sortable and searchable table shows all organisations that have had graduate, intern and/or employer responses in 2021. Only complete counts^[While we have used a two-stage automated checking approach to maximise correct coding of free text responses identifying the employer of each graduate and intern, these numbers may change somewhat with final data cleaning as unidentified or misidentified employers are corrected.] are included.

`r DT::datatable(org_summary)`
